# Student Project README

This repository contains a project developed by students for educational purposes.

## Project Description
The project is a web application designed to facilitate museum visits in Novi Sad by generating personalized routes based on user-selected artworks. Users can select the artworks they want to see, and the application intelligently generates routes based on their preferences. These preferences include optimizing for the shortest distance, chronological order, or similarity in art styles between selected artworks. By tailoring routes to user preferences, the application aims to enhance the museum visiting experience and make it more enjoyable and efficient.
